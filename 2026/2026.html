</div>

<p class="content-text add-padding-b">
    The Scalable HCI Research Symposium is designed to cross pollinate dialogues on Hardware in Human-Computer
    Interaction (HCI), while showcasing Shenzhen's potential as a global innovation hub.
    Drawing inspiration from influential figures in Open Hardware and Hackerspace movements, like Bunnie Huang and Mitch
    Altman, the symposium emphasizes the democratization of access to Shenzhen's manufacturing power. This focus is
    particularly beneficial for communities in developing countries as it amplifies financial accessibility to hardware,
    but it also paves the way for scaling research to unprecedented dimensions and unexplored territories.
    In collaboration with leading open hardware industry partners such as Seeed, the symposium provides invaluable
    insights into these manufacturing intricacies. The recent pandemic has undeniably disrupted global supply chains,
    but with China's reopening, the symposium offers a timely platform to rediscover and delve into Shenzhen's
    revitalized ecosystem.
    Join us for an enlightening journey through the landscape of HCI, where academia meets industry, theory meets
    practice, and potential meets opportunity.
